Keno Antigen
============

Keno Antigen is a community project based on [Lacuna Expanse](http://lacunaexpanse.com)
which has an open API. The community project will take the best ideas
from the original game but also add some exciting new game play features.

Keno Antigen will also make the best use of HTML5, Web Sockets and best 
practices of design for front end (Javascript) to bring the original 
implementation up to date.

What Keno Antigen offers, that very few games offer, is the ability
to run your empire from scripts written in a variety of programming languages.

This documentation describes the new Web Socket API being developed
exclusively for Keno Antigen through which third party tools and scripts can
be written to control your empire.

I hope you stay with us and give us feedback as we release parts of the
game over the coming months.
